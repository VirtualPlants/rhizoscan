-------------------------------

make test functions for all modules

move array.segmentation to 'measurement' or 'segmentation'


    
To think about:
---------------
use of upper case for first module (file&folder) name character ?? is it possible ?
    => upper case is for classes...

create a video module, with an ImageSequence class and maybe a Video (for avi...)
    => need a parent class of all sequence type (virtual ?)
    => maybe a Sequence class that manage sequences of any type of data
    
create a Image3D module (and class) ?

make a (virtual?) class data parent of all data type managed
    python-to-c pointer passing method for all these data: 'ndarray', 'image' and 'Image3D'
    read-write to file => default using numpy array
    

    
DONE list:
----------
remove 'adaptive' filter, and rename 'adaptive2' by 'adaptive'
    => add an option 'kernel' (either gaussian, or uniform)

move array.filter.[---]_kernel to array.kernel ; and remove _kernel suffixe

rename 'array' by 'ndarray'
