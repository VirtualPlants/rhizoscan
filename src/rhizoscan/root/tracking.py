Module to track root archiecture sequences

todo:
 - segment(t+1) to axe(t) distance
    - distance from node(t+1) to node(t): cdist
    - distance from node(t+1) to root segment(t) - listed by axe
    - distance from node(t+1) to root axes(t) - min d(n,s) per axes
    - input: axialtree_t1, graph-t2
    - output:  distance matrix, ???
 
 
 - iterative shortest path to find all axes (lower order 1st)
    - start at parent axe (init with leaves)
    - distance sum should be (an approximation of) a suitable curve distance
    - select "best path", max-cover/min-distance
    
 - root "growth":
    - use (& arrange) the graph-2-axial method?
